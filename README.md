## BANK LOAN REPORT

### Dashboard 1: Overview

In this Bank Loan Report, we aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends using a variety of chart types. These charts will provide a clear and insightful view of the lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling us to gain valuable insights into various loan parameters. 

### Dashboard 2: Details

Within this Bank Loan Report, we acknowledge the necessity for a comprehensive "Details Dashboard" that offers a consolidated view of all essential loan data. This dashboard aims to provide a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, facilitating efficient access to critical information.
Objective:
The primary goal of the Details Dashboard is to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will act as a centralized solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.

### DASHBOARD 3: SUMMARY

To effectively monitor and evaluate our bank's lending activities and performance, it is imperative to develop a comprehensive Bank Loan Report summary. This report  is designed to offer insights into critical loan-related metrics and their fluctuations over time, empowering us to make informed decisions, manage our loan portfolio effectively, and adapt the lending strategies based on emerging trends.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
1. Total Loan Applications: It is essential to determine the aggregate number of loan applications received within a specified timeframe. Additionally, monitoring Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and analyzing Month-over-Month (MoM) changes are crucial for trend identification.
2. Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total sum disbursed as loans is paramount. We must also monitor Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Funded Amount and scrutinize Month-over-Month (MoM) alterations in this metric.
3. Total Amount Received: Tracking the overall amount received from borrowers is vital for assessing cash flow and loan repayment. Analysis of Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observation of Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations are essential.
4. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the mean interest rate across all loans, including MTD calculations, and monitoring Month-over-Month (MoM) changes provides valuable insights into the overall cost of our lending portfolio.
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI of our borrowers enables us to assess their financial well-being. It is imperative to compute the average DTI for all loans, including MTD assessments, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations for a comprehensive understanding.
